# LE Numerical Solver

The Lane-Emden Equation is a mathematical law that relates dimensionless Density (\theta), Pressure (\rho), and Radius (\ksi) of a self-gravitating, spherically symetric fluid given a polytropic index \n. It was formulated by astrophysicists Jonathan Lane and Robert Emden (include links), and is especially useful when understanding the aforementioned quantities inside stars in hydrostatic equilibrium such as the Sun.

For this project, I was looking at specific polytropic indexes (n1 = 1.5 and n2 = 3.5) because ... .Doing so requires a numerical solution, and thus I used the Runge-Kutta method, which is a numerical approximation process for nonlinear differential equations.

You can check some of the results on the Results page, where I also discuss a bit what the plots mean.
